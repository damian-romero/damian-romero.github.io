## Introduction

In recent years, I've noticed a growing trend among students learning Spanish who also have a passion for video games. This got me thinking about how video games can be a natural and enjoyable way to develop reading and listening comprehension skills in a new language. Of course, this is hardly an original thought: there is an entire field of academic research that focuses on language learning through video games. If you don't believe me, just think of the research there is behind Duolingo, for example.  However, many millennials (including myself) and even some boomers learned languages through gaming long before game translations became widely available.

So because many gamers would like to learn Spanish, and many Spanish learners like gaming, I thought I would start exploring and reviewing some popular video games produced in Spanish-speaking countries. The idea here is to tell you about some of the most recently popular video games that have been created by companies from Spanish-speaking countries so that you can try them out yourself. Just don't forget to go to settings and change your language to Spanish!

In the list I have compiled, I talk about each game's unique features for learning Spanish. On a series of follow-up blogs you can expect me to go over some of these games, one by one, exploring their overall usefulness for learning Spanish and share these insights with you.

*Disclaimer*: I only focused on games that were are available through [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/). You might be able to get some of them for your console, but I wouldn't know.
