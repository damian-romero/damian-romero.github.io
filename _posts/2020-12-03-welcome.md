Hi, Damian here. Welcome to my website! Please feel free to navigate around and do contact me if you have any questions or collaboration ideas.

I confess that, for building this website, I was trying to use (and even forked) the [Academic Pages](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) template, which is based on [`Minimal Mistakes`](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes). Still, I was seduced by the original, plus I believe that Academic Pages is not being maintained at the moment of writing.

For a full (but concise) walkthrough about how I built my website using Jekyll, GitHub, and Minimal Mistakes on MacOs Catalina, please navigate to the following link: ['How I built this website']([link](https://d-romero.com/blog/how-i-built-this-website/))

And remember to... 

Jump higher!

\- Damian
