This guide will walk you through the process of installing modpacks using Prism Launcher, specifically focusing on how to get the Gaia's Riddle modpack up and running.

Gaia's Riddle is a new modpack created by [Dr. Bart Simon](https://www.curseforge.com/members/bartssimon/projects) and collaborators from the [TAG Bloc academic group](https://tag.hexagram.ca/) at the [Milieux institute for arts, culture and technology](https://milieux.concordia.ca/). You will find my Gaia's Riddle Let's Play YouTube series at: [https://www.youtube.com/@TypoMC](https://www.youtube.com/@TypoMC).

This is the description of the [Gaia's Riddle modpack](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/gaias-riddle) directly from the CourseForge website:


>A moderately sized modpack featuring mods with dynamic environment mechanics like Pollution of the Realms, Serene Seasons, ColdSweat and Weather, Storms and Tornados.  These are combined with tech/magic progression mods Mekanism, Pneumaticraft, Embers Rekindled and Nature's Aura to create a multiplayer game in which players consider whether to try and control and dominate nature or work with its vicarious conditions. Players will explore and build in a world which feels alive and is not always at the players beck and call. When you are ready, you can even activate the Solar Apocalypse.

>Exploration in the environmental theme features dimension mods like The Aether, StarGate Journey and Alex Caves as well as less popular world gen mods such as Regions Unexplored, [Lets do] Blooming Nature and Biome Makeover. There are also ample group boss activities with the Aether, and L_Ender's Cataclysm and plenty of useful mods for making the solarpunk base of your dreams.
