Thank you for visiting my website.

I am a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Arizona working on research in English, Spanish, and Portuguese.

I have lead and participated in work for *corpus creation, annotation, and management, linguistic analysis, and language engineering* for academia and industry.

My research interests lay in the intersection between *communication outcomes, theoretical linguistics, and big data*.


### Machine Learning Internship ðŸ’¥

Since May 2021 I have been a Machine Learning intern at [Explosion AI](https://explosion.ai/). I am beyond happy to be able to work with all the great people in this team!


### Natural Language Processing Work as a Graduate Assistant ðŸ¤–

I am currently working as a Graduate Research Assistant for Dr. Tracy Crane (University of Miami) and Dr. Steven Bethard (UA School of Information) on an NIH Grant. We use NLP to help improve outcomes of cancer prevention interventions in the U.S. Hispanic Spanish-speaking population, specifically Latinas suffering from ovarian cancer. My duties include:
* Assisting in the writing of a minority supplement grant application
* Creation and management of linguistic annotation for our data, including speaker diarisation, Motivational Interviewing Treatment Integrity (MITI), fidelity scoring, and health-topic annotation
* Theorization of the causal models and cultural limitations of Motivational Interviewing
* Statistical analysis and ML modeling of Lifestyle Intervention for Ovarian Cancer Enhanced Survival (LIVES) data


### Dissertation work ðŸ“š

My dissertation work is on cutting-edge analysis of teacher-student interactions. Specifically,

- The collection of a teacher-student email interaction corpus which includes sociolinguistic, language experience, email experience, and course information about the participants.
- Qualitative and quantitative analysis of such interactions using corpus pragmatics, rapport-management theory, speech act theory,  politeness theory, and variational pragmatics.
- Computational linguistics analysis (principal component analysis, machine learning, deep learning).

**My dissertation committee includes:**
- [Dr. Carmen King de Ramirez](https://carmenkingramirez.com/) (Director)
- [Dr. Julieta Fernandez](https://julietafernandez.faculty.arizona.edu/) (Spanish and Portuguese, SLAT)
- [Dr. Sandiway Fong](http://www.u.arizona.edu/~sandiway/) (Linguistics, Computer Science)
- [Dr. Helena Gomez Adorno](https://www.linkedin.com/in/helena-gomez-adorno-31930524/?originalSubdomain=mx) (IIMAS - UNAM)


### My work philisophy ðŸ’¼

    now = 'e'
    recursively = 'ing'
    print (f"{do + now} and keep {do + recursively}")

while True:
