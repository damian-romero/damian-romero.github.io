Thank you for visiting my website.

I am a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Arizona working on **English, Spanish, and Portuguese** research.

My **language annotation, linguistic analysis, and language engineering** experience has led me to work in group and individual projects in **academia and industry**.

My research interests lay in the intersection between **communication outcomes, theoretical linguistics, and big data**.

My dissertation work is on cutting-edge analysis of teacher-student interactions. Specifically,

- The collection of a teacher-student email interaction corpus which includes sociolinguistic, language experience, email experience, and course information about the participants.
- Qualitative and quantitative analysis of such interactions using corpus pragmatics, rapport-management theory, speech act theory,  politeness theory, and variational pragmatics.
- Computational linguistics analysis (principal component analysis, machine learning, deep learning).

**My dissertation committee includes:**
- [Dr. Carmen King de Ramirez](https://carmenkingramirez.com/) (Director)
- [Dr. Julieta Fernandez](https://julietafernandez.faculty.arizona.edu/) (Spanish and Portuguese, SLAT)
- [Dr. Sandiway Fong](http://www.u.arizona.edu/~sandiway/) (Linguistics, Computer Science)
- [Dr. Helena Gomez Adorno](https://www.linkedin.com/in/helena-gomez-adorno-31930524/?originalSubdomain=mx) (IIMAS - UNAM)
