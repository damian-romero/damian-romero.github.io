Thank you for visiting my website.

I am a computational linguist diving deep into the world of educational technologies.

I can often be found buried under a mountain of research articles, battling it out in video games, or conjuring code on my computer.

I have lead and worked on *data creation, annotation, and management, linguistic analysis, and language engineering* for AI in both academia and industry.

My research interests lay in the intersection between *humans communicating with AI, educational technology, and gamification*.

```python
def jump_higher():
    do = 'improv'
    now = 'e'
    recursively = 'ing'
    print (f"{do + now} and keep {do + recursively}")

while True:
    jump_higher()
```
